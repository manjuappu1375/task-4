The Lost Star
A little star named Twinkle falls from the sky and lands in a garden. 
She feels sad and alone. A kind girl named Lily finds Twinkle and 
helps her shine again by telling her stories of the night sky. 
Together, they create a magical night filled with sparkles, 
and Twinkle learns that friends can help you shine brighter.
